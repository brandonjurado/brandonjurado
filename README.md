# Hey, I'm Brandon! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at USAA, where I work on building highly resilient distributed applications that are used to thwart malicious actors. I enjoy learning and building stuff related to whatever trend I'm following at the time! In the past that has been: blockchain, React, Angular, Java, Vue and Swift to name a few, sometimes circling back.

## Previously...
* I worked at American Airlines on the booking path for AA.com.
* I graduated from Tarleton State University, where I studied Computer Science and helped build the CS department and their participation in hackathons.
* I have been actively particpating in hackathons since 2016.

## In my free time
* I enjoy playing video games. Recently, I've been playing CoD WarZone and NFS: Heat - FPS and racing video games, my favorite.
* I have been obsessed with reading finance books lately.
* I try to hack away at building cool things.
