# Hey, I'm Brandon! 👋

I'm a software engineer at USAA, where I work on building highly resilient distributed applications that are used to thwart malicious actors. I enjoy learning and building stuff related to whatever trend I'm following at the time! In the past that has been: blockchain, React, Angular, Java, Vue and Swift to name a few, sometimes circling back.

## Previously...
* I worked at American Airlines on the booking path for AA.com. ✈️
* I graduated from Tarleton State University (Texas A&M University System), where I studied Computer Science and helped build the CS department's involvement in hackathons. 🤓
* I interned at a couple startups where I wore many hats from full-stack to SysAdmin roles. 🧙🏼‍♂️

## In my free time
* I enjoy playing video games. 🎮 Recently, I've been playing CoD WarZone and NFS: Heat - FPS and racing video games, my favorite.
* I have been obsessed with reading finance books lately. 📚
* I try to hack away at building cool things. 🔨
