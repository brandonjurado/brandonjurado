# Hey, I'm Brandon! 👋

As a software engineer, I specialize in developing emerging technology solutions. I have a passion for continuous learning and enjoy building tools related to the latest trends in software development. Currently, I am focused on Web3 and Solidity, which have reignited my interest in cryptocurrency since discovering Bitcoin in 2013. Throughout my career, I have worked with a variety of programming languages, including GoLang, React, Angular, Vue, Kotlin, and Swift. I am constantly exploring new technologies and expanding my skills to stay ahead of the curve.
