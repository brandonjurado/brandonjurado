# Hey, I'm Brandon! 👋

I'm a software engineer at T-Mobile, where I work on building emerging technology solutions. I enjoy learning and building tools related to whatever trend I'm following at the time! Currently that is all things Web3 and Solidity, which has rekindled my interest in crypto from when I first discovered BTC in 2013. In the past, my interests and/or side projects have been built on: GoLang, React, Angular, Vue, Kotlin and Swift to name a few.

## Previously...
* I helped identify malicious actors through Identity Access Management for [USAA](https://www.usaa.com/) 🕵️🏦
* I worked at American Airlines on the booking path for [AA.com](https://www.aa.com/) ✈️
* I graduated from [Tarleton State University](https://www.tarleton.edu/home/index.html) (Texas A&M University System), where I studied Computer Science and helped build the CS department's involvement in hackathons 🤓
* I interned at a couple startups where I wore many hats from full-stack to SysAdmin roles 🧙🏼‍♂️

## In my free time
* I enjoy gaming 🎮 
* I read books on financial independence, as well as online tech news 📚
* I try to hack away at building cool things 🔨
